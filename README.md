# HexGame
This project is designed to provide a specific implementation of a [game of hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) in order to falicitate the experimentation with AI game playing and different game interfaces.

As this is a personal project intended for my own learning, outside pull requests are, at this moment, not allowed.  Feel free to fork this repo if you want to play with it and, if you really want, feel free to contact me directly to discuss joining the project.
